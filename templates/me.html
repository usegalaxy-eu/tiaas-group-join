<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>
We have deployed a dedicated compute node just for your training session to
use. No one outside of your training has access to this machine. Completely
transparently to you, all of the jobs that you run in Galaxy, during the
period of the training event, will "prefer" to run on this machine. If there is
no room on that machine, they will run on any other machine in our cluster with
resources.
